Version 0.1
===========

Changelog
---------

Adds number of existing fuzzy rough set algorithms.

New algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FRFS
* FRONEC
* FROVOCO
* FRPS

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* `neighbours.FRNNClassifier` replaced by `neighbours.FRNN`.
* Classifiers give confidence scores; absolute class predictions can be obtained with utility functions.
* Classifiers follow construct/query pattern; scikit-learn fit/predict pattern can be obtained with utility class.
* `neighbours.owa_operators` moved to `utils.owa_operators`.
* `utils.OWAOperator` no longer initialised with fixed `k`, has to be passed to method calls instead.
* `utils.OWAOperator` method calls and functions in `utils.np_utils` now accept fractional and None `k`.
